# Holds the base url that points to the document store. It will be used as

#
# This property can be used in all profiles where it's possible to upload files and
# need to be referenced under a path of a server.
#
# The property was introduced to be able to connect UVP NI installation to
# uvp-verbund.de. Since all document urls were relative before. With this
# property set to an absolute base url, exchange of datasets between uvp
# ingrid installations is no problem anymore.

#  If set to true existing addresses are overwritten during import of ISO 19139
#  data.
#
#  The default behavior of the ISO 19139 import is not to overwrite
#  existing addresses (see INGRID33-16). This allows address management through
#  the editor ans makes sure that the addresses are not accidentally overwritten
#  by an ISO 19139 import.
#
#  This property was introduced because in cases were the datasets are only managed
#  by CSW-T imports, there was no way to overwrite existing address data by CSW-T
#  transactions.
#
#  see also https://redmine.informationgrid.eu/issues/1764
#
#
# import.overwrite.addresses=false

#  If set to true no publication condition check is executed against datasets that
#  reference an address that will be overwritten by an ISO 19139 import.
#
#  This property was introduced because in cases were the datasets are only managed
#  by CSW-T imports, this check is not necessary. All datasets are published and have
#  the same publication condition. Also this check can be very time consuming in cases
#  of addresses referenced by many datasets (HZG use case has 25.000 datasets
#  referencing the same address.)
#
#  This property depends on import.overwrite.addresses:true.
